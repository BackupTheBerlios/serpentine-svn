- When a list of files is added order the files which have the same album name 
  and track number
- recent files support (?)
- On nautilus, right click on a group of media files and "write to cd..."
- Have a way to minimize to tray on progress dialog
- The list of drives must be generated according to the ones not recording
- Handle erros when we are recording
- Lock the drive when converting audio
- Before we start recording we check if the size of the media size fits in the
medium and should show an appropriate dialog. We need to implement it as a
plugin since it depends on D-Bus
- plug mediasize blocks whith some drives, should be made async
- Drives list and drive speed should be refreshed more often
- Add a Copy Disc feature
- double clicking a music should 'gnome-open' it so that the user can have a playback (or start one on hover? a toggle button Preview below the disc capacity?)
- mc solaar oggs have the GST_ERROR? Progress > 1: 6651448.0 problem, thus affecting the progress bar (it gets back to zero).
- distutils serpentine?
- gettext it
- when recording finishes the progressbar should stop and a text should appear advising the user it finished.
- when recording finishes the progressbar is not at 100%, why?
- use replace button (what is this button?) instead of OK in replace file dialog, when saving playlists. move file replace dialog to gtkutil, maybe add SaveFileDialog
- dist utils serpentine
