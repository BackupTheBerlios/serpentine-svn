Changes from 0.5:
 - New usage widget: progressbar should be used for progress. The new usage disc widget
   improves the user experience by reflecting the disc contents in a disc like display.

 - Integration friendly: special command line arguments make integration with other
   applications easier.

 - New Muine plugin: you can write your playlist to a CD directly from Muine.

 - Save and load playlist: you can now open and save playlists inside Serpentine.

 - User interface polish: the user interface was improved and made more similar to
   nautilus-cd-burner.
