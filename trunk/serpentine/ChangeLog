    #18643)

    * serpentine/converting.py:
    * serpentine/mainwindow.py:
    * serpentine/operations.py:

	* __init__.py:
	* serpentine:

	progress window is no longer closed but the cancel button changes to a
	close button (should this happen? HIG is a bit confusing).
	
	
2005-02-07 Tiago Cogumbreiro <cogumbreiro@users.sf.net>

	is optional. TreeView is no longer set insensitive when loading, it
	uncovered a bug in Gtk+/PyGtk and some theming bugs. Renamed from
	gtk_util to gtkutil to conform to Python's coding style. Now uses
	Gtk.AboutDialog instead of GNOME's one. Started refactoring the
	recording method into a function or class in order for Serpentine to

	* mastering.py: (AddFile.on_metadata): (GtkMusicList):
	(AudioMastering.__on_dnd_drop):
	Removed redundant insert_before/insert_after to only an insert method
	(which works as insert_before, as expected).
	
	* mastering.py:
	(AudioMastering.__on_dnd_drop):
	Corrected a bug where it tries
	to insert at the position after the last one (in this case it should append).
