	* scripts/serpentine: Serpentine can optionally throw an exception, catch it
	and print the error message.
	
	* converting.py:
	* audio.py: Changed license to LGPL, since it isn't linked to any GPL'ed
	module.
	
	* gaw.py: Included copyright noticed (LGPL)
	
	* __init__.py: Removed DATA_DIR contant, it was moved to a new module:

	the associated nautiulsburn.Drive. When the operation is finished the 
	progress window is no longer closed but the cancel button changes to a
