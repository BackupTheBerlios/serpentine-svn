Public fields should have camelCase private, local and protected fields should have unix_style, example:

class Foo:
	def _do_something (self, obj):
		pass
	
	def doSomething (self):
		a = AnotherClass ()
		local_var = self._do_something (a)
	
	aVariable = 12
	
	_a_private_variable = "This variable is for internal use only!"

Constants in CAPS, module names must not contain underscores.

Spaces should be used after parenthisis, including functions with no arguments.

Use 4 spaces for identation, do *not* use tabs.

On properties always define getFoo instead of private methods, this gives a hint on the
class user what operations he can do over that property. Like this example:

class Bar (object):
	def getSomething (self):
		return self.__something
	def setSomething (self, something):
		self.__something = something
	def unsetSomething (self):
		defl self.__something
	something = property (getSomething, setSomething, unsetSomething)

	# Now an example on a read-only field
	def getAge (self):
		return 12
	age = property (getAge)
