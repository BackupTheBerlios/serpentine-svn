Serpentine is an application for mastering audio CDs.
In it's design simplicity will be the keyword. Dnd and saving states (think nautilus) will play an important role here, since it will cleanup the UI alot.
Serpentine will try to abide to GNOME HIG v2.0.

The project is not yet functional but great part of it already is.

It depends on atleast: pygtk-2.4 gst-python-0.7 libnautilus-burn-python-0.1

libnautilus-burn-python is currently available through:
