- When a list of files is added order the files which have the same album name 
  and track number
- recent files support (?)
- On nautilus, right click on a group of media files and "write to cd..."
- Have a way to minimize to tray on progress dialog
- The list of drives must be generated according to the ones not recording
- Lock the drive when converting audio
- plug mediasize: blocks whith some drives, should be made async
- double clicking a music should 'gnome-open' it so that the user can have a playback (or start one on hover? a toggle button Preview below the disc capacity?)
- mc solaar oggs have the GST_ERROR? Progress > 1: 6651448.0 problem, thus affecting the progress bar (it gets back to zero).
- use replace button (what is this button?) instead of OK in replace file dialog, when saving playlists. move file replace dialog to gtkutil, maybe add SaveFileDialog
- dist utils serpentine (?)
